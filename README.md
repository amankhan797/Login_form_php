# Login Form Project

Welcome to the Login Form project repository! This project demonstrates a secure login form implementation using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), PHP, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Install XAMPP or any other local development environment that supports PHP and MySQL.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

- ```sh
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-form.git

### Step 2: Create 'login.php'

- Create a 'login.php' file in the 'C:\xampp\htdocs' (or equivalent) path location. This will serve as the entry point for the project.

### Step 3: Configure the MySQL Database
- 1. Open phpMyAdmin in your web browser by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
- 2. Create a new database (e.g., login_db).
- 3. Create a table within the database (e.g., users) with appropriate fields like id, username, and password.

### Step 4: Update Database Configuration
- Open the 'login.php' file and update the database connection configuration with your database credentials.

### Step 5: Access the Project
- Start your local server '(e.g., XAMPP)' and visit 'http://localhost/login.php' in your web browser. You should see the login form.
